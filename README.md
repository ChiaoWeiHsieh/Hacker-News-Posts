# Hacker-News-Posts

This project aims to analyse Hacker News posts using a dataset derived from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) with a goal to answer the below 2 questions:
- Do`Ask HN posts`or`Show HN posts`receive more comments on average?
  - An`Ask HN`post is a type of post users submit to ask a specific question on the Hacker News community, such as "How to improve my personal website?" 
  - A`Show HN`post is a type of post users submit to show a project, product, or just generally something interesting on the Hacker News community.
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

  
Note that this project provides opportunities for me to understand and practise the below basic skills:
1. Use the datetime module and its time class.
2. Use the sorted(iterable_object, key, reverse=False) function to sort the order in a list.
3. Use dictionary to make frequency tables, and calcuate the average values of the data.
