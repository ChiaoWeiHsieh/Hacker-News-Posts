    "## Abstract\n",
    "This project aims to analyse Hacker News posts using a dataset derived from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) with a goal to answer the below 2 questions:\n",
    "- Do`Ask HN posts`or`Show HN posts`receive more comments on average?\n",
    "  - An`Ask HN`post is a type of post users submit to ask a specific question on the Hacker News community, such as \"How to improve my personal website?\" \n",
    "  - A`Show HN`post is a type of post users submit to show a project, product, or just generally something interesting on the Hacker News community.\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Note that this project provides opportunities for me to understand and practise the below basic skills:\n",
    "1. Use the datetime module and its time class.\n",
    "2. Use the sorted(iterable_object, key, reverse=False) function to sort the order in a list.\n",
    "3. Use dictionary to make frequency tables, and calcuate the average values of the data."
